      "question": "Explain VLOOKUP",
      "answer": "VLOOKUP, which stands for \"Vertical Lookup,\" is a powerful function in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that searches for and retrieves specific data from a table. It works by looking for a value in the leftmost column of a specified table and then returning a value from a different column in the same row. ",
      "evaluation": {
        "score": 7,
        "feedback": "Good start!  The definition of VLOOKUP is accurate and clear. However,  the explanation lacks crucial details to get a higher score.  It doesn't mention the importance of the fourth argument (range_lookup) and its impact on exact vs. approximate matches, which is essential to fully understanding VLOOKUP's functionality.  It also doesn't cover potential errors (like #N/A) and how to handle them.  A stronger answer would include a simple example showing a VLOOKUP formula with different values for the fourth argument (TRUE/FALSE or 1/0) and explain the results.  For instance, explaining how using FALSE ensures an exact match and TRUE allows for an approximate match (and the potential pitfalls of approximate matching) would greatly improve the answer."

      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it?",
      "answer": "A Pivot Table is a data summarization tool in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that allows you to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data. It does not alter your original data but instead \"pivots\" it to provide a different, interactive view, helping you analyze, visualize, and present large datasets quickly and easily",
      "evaluation": {
        "score": 9,
        "feedback": "Excellent definition of a Pivot Table and its core functionality.  You accurately described its non-destructive nature and highlighted its key benefits for data analysis and presentation. To improve, consider briefly mentioning specific functionalities like filtering, grouping, and calculations (e.g., sum, average, count) that are crucial to Pivot Table's power.  Adding a concise example of a use case (e.g., summarizing sales data by region and product) would further strengthen the answer."

      "question": "Design an Excel template for monthly budgeting (describe columns/structure)",
      "answer": "When designing an Excel template for monthly budgeting, the goal is to create a clear, functional, and automated tool that allows for easy tracking and analysis of income and expenses. The template should be structured logically to provide a detailed view of monthly finances, while also giving a high-level summary.\n\nHere is a design for a monthly budgeting template, with a description of the key columns and structure.\nTemplate structure\nA robust monthly budget template should consist of at least two sheets:\nTransactions Log: A detailed, running log of all income and expense items for the month.\nMonthly Summary Dashboard: A summary sheet that pulls data from the log to present an overview of the month's finances, including visualizations.\n",
      "evaluation": {
        "score": 4,
        "feedback": "The response demonstrates a basic understanding of the task, outlining the need for a clear and functional template with a transactions log and summary dashboard. However, it lacks crucial detail.  The description is too high-level; it doesn't specify column headers, data types, formulas, or visualization choices for the dashboard.  No mention is made of error handling, data validation, or features to enhance usability like data entry forms or drop-down menus for categories.  The design is incomplete and lacks the depth expected for a robust budgeting template. To improve, the candidate should provide specific examples of column headers (e.g., Date, Description, Category, Amount, Payment Method), data validation rules (e.g., preventing non-numeric entries in the Amount column), and formulas used for calculations and summaries (e.g., SUMIF, SUMIFS).  Including details on the types of visualizations planned for the dashboard (e.g., charts, graphs) would also strengthen the response."

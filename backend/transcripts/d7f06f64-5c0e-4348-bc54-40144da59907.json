      "question": "Explain VLOOKUP",
      "answer": "VLOOKUP, which stands for \"Vertical Lookup,\" is a powerful function in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that searches for and retrieves specific data from a table. It works by looking for a value in the leftmost column of a specified table and then returning a value from a different column in the same row. \nThe syntax for a VLOOKUP function is:\n=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])",

        "feedback": "```json\n{\n  \"score\": 8,\n  \"feedback\": \"The candidate provides a good explanation of VLOOKUP, including its purpose and basic syntax.  The description is clear and accurate. The explanation of what the function does is easy to understand.  However, the response lacks examples.  Adding a simple example, such as `=VLOOKUP(\\\"Apple\\\",A1:B10,2,FALSE)` along with a short explanation of how it would work given sample data in cells A1:B10, would significantly improve the answer and demonstrate a practical understanding.  The candidate should also mention the limitations of VLOOKUP, specifically that the lookup value must be in the first column of the table array and it only returns the first match if there are duplicates.  Mentioning `APPROXIMATE MATCH` and `EXACT MATCH` (range_lookup = TRUE/FALSE) with a brief explanation would also boost the score.  Finally, while the syntax is correct, explaining each argument separately (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup]) with concise descriptions would enhance clarity.\"\n}\n```\n"

      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it?",
      "answer": "A Pivot Table is a data summarization tool in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that allows you to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data. It does not alter your original data but instead \"pivots\" it to provide a different, interactive view, helping you analyze, visualize, and present large datasets quickly and easily.",

You accurately defined a PivotTable and its core functionality: summarizing and reorganizing data without modifying the source.  Mentioning its interactive nature and usefulness for large datasets is also a plus. To improve, consider adding specific examples of use cases. For instance, you could mention summarizing sales by region and time period, or counting the occurrences of different categories.  Adding these practical applications would demonstrate a deeper understanding of its power and versatility.\"\n}\n```\n"

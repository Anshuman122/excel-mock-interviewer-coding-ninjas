      "question": "Explain VLOOKUP",
      "answer": "VLOOKUP, which stands for \"Vertical Lookup,\" is a powerful function in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that searches for and retrieves specific data from a table. It works by looking for a value in the leftmost column of a specified table and then returning a value from a different column in the same row. \nThe syntax for a VLOOKUP function is:\n=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])",

        "feedback": "```json\n{\n  \"score\": 8,\n  \"feedback\": \"The candidate provides a good explanation of VLOOKUP, including its purpose and basic syntax.  The definition is clear and accurate.  However, the explanation lacks crucial details and examples to demonstrate a deeper understanding.  For example, the explanation doesn't mention the importance of the `[range_lookup]` argument (TRUE/FALSE for approximate/exact match), which is critical for accurate usage and often a source of errors.  Furthermore, a concrete example showcasing a VLOOKUP formula applied to a specific scenario would significantly strengthen the answer.  To improve, the candidate should illustrate the function with a sample table and demonstrate both approximate and exact match scenarios, highlighting the impact of the `range_lookup` argument.  Additionally, they could mention potential limitations of VLOOKUP, such as its reliance on the lookup column being the leftmost column, and suggest alternatives like INDEX/MATCH for more flexible lookups.\"\n}\n```\n"

      "question": "What is a Pivot Table and when would you use it?",
      "answer": "A Pivot Table is a data summarization tool in spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets that allows you to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data. It does not alter your original data but instead \"pivots\" it to provide a different, interactive view, helping you analyze, visualize, and present large datasets quickly and easily",

        "feedback": "```json\n{\n  \"score\": 8,\n  \"feedback\": \"Good answer!  Your definition accurately captures the core functionality of a PivotTable as a data summarization and reorganization tool.  Mentioning its non-destructive nature and interactive capabilities is excellent.  To improve, consider adding specific examples of use cases. For instance, you could mention summarizing sales data by region and product, or calculating the average order value for different customer segments.  These examples would make the explanation more concrete and demonstrate a deeper understanding of its practical applications.  Adding a brief mention of the different aggregation functions available (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, etc.) would also strengthen the answer.\"\n}\n```\n"

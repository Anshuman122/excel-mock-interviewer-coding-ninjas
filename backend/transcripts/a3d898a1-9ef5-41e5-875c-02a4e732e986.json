(e.g., direct entry, dropdown menus for categories, data import from bank statements)\\n* **Categorization System:** How will expenses and income be categorized? (e.g., hierarchical structure, customizable categories)\\n* **Formulae and Automation:** What specific formulas will be used for calculations (e.g., SUM, SUMIF, VLOOKUP)?  Mention any automation for things like calculating totals, differences from budget, or highlighting overspending.\\n* **Data Visualization:**  How will the data be presented? (e.g., charts, graphs, conditional formatting)\\n* **Sheet Structure:**  Describe the layout of the different sheets (e.g., separate sheets for income, expenses, summary, yearly view).\\n* **Error Handling:** How will the template handle potential errors (e.g., incorrect data input)?\\n\\nThe answer needs to move beyond general statements and delve into the practical implementation details to achieve a higher score.\"\n}\n```\n"
